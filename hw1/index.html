		We've already added one heading per task, to make your write-up as navigable when grading. Please fit your write-up within these sections!
		-->

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework. <br><br>

		We implemented a graphic rendering engine during this homework. To do this, we had to implement various parts of an engine skeleton to draw images correctly, which revolved around drawing triangles correctly. A lot goes into rendering images at a level such as this, such as applying transforms, interpreting color values, sampling to accommodate for resolution changes, and so on. Texture mapping was very intriguing, considering that the process of mapping flat images into non-flat surfaces can be inherently complex.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<b>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words. </b><br>
		We implemented the line test then ran through the pixels in the triangle’s bounding box for the intersection between the three line tests. The pixels in this test are in the triangle, so we fill them in.<br><br>
		<b>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. The bounding box of the triangle is defined as the smallest rectangle that can be drawn whilst ensuring that the entire triangle is within it.</b><br>
		Presently we just check the bounding box itself. It is no worse but also no better..<br><br>
		<b>Show a png screenshot of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene.</b><br>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<b>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</b><br>
		In order to prevent hard edges in our triangles, we use supersampling. We effectively just the triangles rendered on a larger sample buffer in a similar fashion to normal rendering. We mostly changed the coordinate math to account for the larger buffer size. This goes for other various methods involving the sample buffer, too. For lines and points (not supersampled) we just fill in all the relevant pixel’s samples with a solid color. When resolving the samples, we simply average all the supersamples into a single pixel. <br><br>
		<b>Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. Explain why these results are observed.</b><br>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				</td>
			  </tr>

		</div>
		One can observe a decrease in jaggies along the edge of the triangle due to the increased amount of samples along the edge of the triangle. The increased amount of samples allows for greater precision in rendering the triangle's edges.


		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		<b><br>Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, like waving or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. Save your svg file as my_robot.svg in your docs/ directory and show a png screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words. </br></b>

		<br> We attempted to replicate the image on the right with our robot, which involved applying rotations and translations to the robot's legs and arms as well as a rotation to the whole robot asset.
		

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<b>Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should produce a smoothly blended color triangle.</b> <br>
		Barycentric coordinates are a coordinate system that allows for greater precision across a triangle. Coordinates of a point are determined by a proportion between the line from a point to a vertex and the line from the vertex to the line opposite from the vertex, applied to all three vertices in a triangle. <br> <br>
		<b>Show a png screenshot of svg/basic/test7.svg with default viewing parameters and sample rate 1. If you make any additional images with color gradients, include them.</b><br>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<b>Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping. Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear. </b> <br>
		Pixel sampling is the act of grabbing data from points on an image, which are represented by position as pixels. This is used in the process of texture mapping, where pixels from a texture are sampled onto a triangle using barycentric coordinates to cover a triangle with a texture properly. <br>
		Nearest sampling takes a pixel sample from the pixel closest to the sampled coordinate in the texture, while bilinear takes the four nearest pixel samples according to the sampled coordinate and interpolates a final sample using the four pixel samples. <br> <br>
		<b>Check out the svg files in the svg/texmap/ directory. Use the pixel inspector to find a good example of where bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling. Show and compare four png screenshots using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel. </b>

		<b>Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between the two methods and why. </b> <br>
		Nearest sampling contains sharper colors and details but these sharper colors contrast with one another and may cause pixels to become more apparent. Bilinear appears more blurry due to the linear interpolation in the sampling stage, but there is a less apparent pixelated look to it upon closer inspection. A large difference between the two will occur when textures are stylized to look pixelated such as within video games, to which the nearest sampling method will produce a sharper look compared to bilinear. <br>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<b>Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it for texture mapping. </b> <br>
		Level sampling uses mipmapping to keep the image clear when the texture is sampled too frequently (i.e. the image is rendered smaller than its texture’s resolution). This has smaller, “pre-blurred,” versions of the texture that prevent aliasing when zoomed out. For our implementation, we calculate the mipmap level with UV coordinate approximation with nearby samples, and choose an appropriate mipmap level that prevents both too much as well as too little detail from interfering with the image quality. We implemented a couple methods of level sampling, those being nearest as well as linear interpolation, which in combination with bilinear sampling, creates trilinear sampling. <br><br>
		<b>You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various techniques. </b> <br> 
		Increasing the number of samples per pixel (supersampling) is theoretically correct, increasing the accuracy of each pixel. However, increasing the sampling rate exponentially increases computation speed and memory usage, and relies on a very large number of samples to stop aliasing in very high frequency textures. <br>
		Pixel sampling helps with the image when it’s zoomed in by interpolating between pixels. Bilinear sampling as opposed to nearest sampling helps prevent hard pixel edges in the texture, while not having too much computational overhead since linear interpolation is relatively cheap. <br>
		Level sampling helps with sampling the image when it’s too small. Mipmapping creates logarithmically smaller versions of the image, which does require a bit more memory. However, as opposed to massive amounts of supersampling, it is much more efficient at preventing aliasing in shrunken textures. <br> <br>

		<b>Using a png file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, using the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, L_ZERO and P_LINEAR, L_NEAREST and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR. </b><br>
